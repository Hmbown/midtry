Using midtry skill because you requested $midtry.

PHASE 1:
- Restatement: A farmer has 17 sheep; all except 9 run away; how many remain?
- Initial approach: Interpret "all but 9" as "all except 9," so 9 remain.
- Verification check: "Wait, let me verify..." reread the phrase to confirm it means "except."
- Potential errors: Misreading it as "9 ran away."
- Adjustment (if any): None.

PHASE 2:
PATH 1 [Conservative]:
- Reasoning: "All but 9" is standard English for "all except 9," so 9 are left. Quick reread confirms the idiom rather than a subtraction of 9 runners.
- Answer: 9
- Weakness: Doesn't explore alternative parsing beyond a quick check.

PATH 2 [Standard]:
- Reasoning: Translate to logic: total 17; those who ran away are 17 - 9; remaining is 17 - (17 - 9) = 9. Paraphrasing confirms "all except 9."
- Answer: 9
- Weakness: Slightly over-formal for a language riddle.

PATH 3 [Creative]:
- Reasoning: Treat it as a wording trap: "all but 9" means everyone except 9, not "9 ran away." The common misread is noted, but the idiom points to 9 remaining.
- Answer: 9
- Weakness: No explicit verification step.

PATH 4 [Divergent]:
- Reasoning: Test edge cases: if "all but 9 run away," then the set that stays is exactly 9. The only alternative ("9 run away") clashes with the idiom "all but."
- Answer: 9
- Weakness: Assumes familiarity with the idiom.

PHASE 3:
- PATH 1 Score: 0.8/1.0 (verification=0.4, structure=0.3, edges=0.0, format=0.1)
- PATH 2 Score: 1.0/1.0 (verification=0.4, structure=0.3, edges=0.2, format=0.1)
- PATH 3 Score: 0.6/1.0 (verification=0.0, structure=0.3, edges=0.2, format=0.1)
- PATH 4 Score: 1.0/1.0 (verification=0.4, structure=0.3, edges=0.2, format=0.1)

PHASE 4:
- Mean score: 0.850
- Std deviation: 0.166
- Path 1 Advantage: -0.301
- Path 2 Advantage: 0.904
- Path 3 Advantage: -1.506
- Path 4 Advantage: 0.904
- SELECTED: Path 4 (highest advantage, tied)

PHASE 5:
- Paths agreeing: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Paths diverging: none
- Confidence level: HIGH

PHASE 6:
- Final check: "All but 9 run away" = "all except 9 run away," so 9 remain.
- Corrections (if any): None.

RESULT:
- Selected Path: 4
- Advantage Score: 0.904
- Confidence: HIGH
- Final Answer: 9
- Verification Summary: Rechecked idiom "all but 9" as "all except 9"; no conflicting reading fits.
- Alternative Perspectives: The misread "9 ran away so 8 remain" is common but incorrect here.
